Nice to know - {

  [Debug Scene Manager Exists] + [In the scene] + [Mouse Button Down Left] + [Mouse Move] + [any physics object]:
    drag the object around.
    buggy and not intentional.
    but can stay as long as its semi working
    will stop working after deactivating the level editor for the first time.
    might get removed.
